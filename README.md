Acceleration due to gravity:

- Find gravitational constant by plotting v_f^2 / 2\*Dh
  Projectile Motion:
- Find the optimal angle dependent on distance from the wall for the highest height.
  Uniform Circular Motion:
- Use the slope of T^2 / r and multiply additional constants to find centripedal force
  Moment of Inertia:
- Find the moment of inertia of a spinning disk via multiple weights. Found by plotting torque / angular acceleration
